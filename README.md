## Breast Cancer Diagnosis Machine Learning Models
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that implement machine learning models for breast cancer diagnosis. The models are based on the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms. The notebooks provide step-by-step explanations and code to train and evaluate the models using breast cancer dataset.

## Notebooks
Roshni_Raveendran_V1.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest classifier for breast cancer diagnosis. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The Random Forest algorithm is known for its ability to handle complex relationships and provide accurate predictions.

Roshni_Raveendran_V2.ipynb: This notebook showcases the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier for breast cancer diagnosis. It focuses on the construction of a decision tree , training the model, and evaluating its performance. Decision Trees offer interpretability and can capture important features for classification tasks.

## Dataset
The notebooks utilize the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset consists of features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, and the target variable indicates whether the mass is benign or malignant.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are used in the notebooks:

scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics\
pandas: for data manipulation and analysis\
numpy: for numerical computations
